## OF-Scraper-GUI / OF-Scraper Live Stream Monitor

Reference: <https://github.com/cjb900/OF-Scraper-GUI/tree/main/OF-Scraper-3.14.7/ofscraper/plugins/live_stream_monitor>

The automatic live recorder uses the subscription `hasStream` discovery and
`/users/{username}/streams/active?view=full_with_check` observations from this
project. The Web Audio destination tap and detached audio-element tracking in
`ofdl/live_capture.js` are adapted from its MediaRecorder approach. Scheduling,
Tk integration, request restrictions, bounded ordered chunk transport and output
lifecycle were implemented for this application. No native Agora SDK is bundled.
These observations are not an official platform contract or a real-account test
of this application.
